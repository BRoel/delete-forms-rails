# DELETE Forms and Requests

## Objectives

- draw a delete route mapping to a destroy action
- explain the problem with submitting a delete Requests
- wrap a delete button in a form with _method=delete
- use form_tag to build a delete form for an object
- build a destroy action that finds the instance and destroys it and redirects to index
- use form_for to build a delete form for an object
- use link_to and button_to :method => :delete but explain briefly how the JS is working to do the same thing above

## Notes

Goal is to get them to understand how the DELETE actions are built.
